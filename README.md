# RemoteJacker

RemoteJacker is code injection via thread hijacking. Code injection via thread hijacking on Windows refers to a method where developers would inject a DLL or code into a codecave or by allocating the memory. The page with the injected code is set to have executable rights. A thread is hijacked in the process to get this code location to execute. This is done by using the routines GetThreadContext & SetThreadContext. It's done by suspending the process, getting a thread's context (it could be executing any operation at the time), and then setting the extended instruction pointer to the code location we want to execute. Then SetThreadContext is called to finalize this. Process is resumed. This project hijacks threads by causing an exception and having the exception dispatcher redirect the thread to another code location.
